            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Romberg" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Bernhard Romberg</a> was a German cellist and composer. He greatly contributed to the instrument's development by making improvements
        to the fingerboard and by suggesting that smaller versions be made so that children could more easily learn to play the cello. He
        was one of the first cellists to perform primarily from memory, and he mostly played his own work.
